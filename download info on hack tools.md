# download info on hack tools

given the name of the hack tool, you may not be able to tell what the tool is (written in python? hosted on github? online tool?) and you want to use search engine to find possible entries. you may take snapshots on these pages and index them.

if the hack tool is linked to some website, you can index the website. if you find it inside some package index or package manager, you will know how to install the package.

[Scraper](https://github.com/henson/Scraper) scrape popular github repositories every day

if you want all README pages on github, you first need to collect all github repo urls. you may also collect info on github repos (OSINT). you can retrieve all repos link to given user with github api (quota limited). you can search github on github or search engine with some juicy/promising keywords then collect repo name, username, keywords, repeat the search.

there are few github repo archives avaliable for download. the github archive program packed many repos to arctic, the list is called [Greatest Hits](https://archiveprogram.github.com/assets/img/archive-repos.txt)

[gharchive](https://www.gharchive.org/) provides many websites for monitoring github repos
