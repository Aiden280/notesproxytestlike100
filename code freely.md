# AGI playground, a place for AGI to act/code freely

some article says deep neural networks are t2 level, human are t3 level (connected dnns) and to train a t3 level intel you need t4 level intel (like the earth, or a group of t3 intels)

you must setup this playground then you begin to learn stuff and libraries of AGI. but once you have one, don't move around, stick to it! you need time to develop the general adaptor and make clear and achievable goals!

terminal, GUI, program, API, network

please check my previous efforts on building AGI, namely: AGI, lazero, metalazero
