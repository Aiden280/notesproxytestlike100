# 自动发短信 邮件 自动接收短信 接收邮件 mail sms automatic sending ad broadcasting, email verification, sms verification, sms login, email login, temp mail

email marketing is quantity over quality. know your customers' preference by linking their accounts on other platforms, telemetry.

icloud's "hide my email" service seems only provide few email aliases. account registered from web without logged in any apple device (maybe virtualbox has a shot?) will not have email service.

yahoo provides the most email alias up to 500. however to get one yahoo account one needs offshore phone numbers. online sms receivers are not so reliable (not even usable for yahoo registration), and those found from google searches (like [free receive sms](https://www.freereceivesms.com/) (这个网站有反js调试 自动暂停执行), which has simple interface for fetching data, and you can [search this site on github](https://github.com/search?q=freereceivesms.com&type=code) to get more sources and potential API adaptors) have chances to get registered yahoo accounts.

email bulk senders are equipped with email templates, statistics (like opened or not, click data monitoring)

vary your email style and content unless you want to get blocked/trashed by servers

searching for "site:pastebin.com @yahoo.com" to get some email addresses
