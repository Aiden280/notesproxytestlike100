there are some code in his repo about scraping proxies. running this on kaggle or github ci providers.

on github search for "clash" "ssr" "proxy" "shadowsocks" "v2ray" "fanqiang" or some keywords obvious to you then sort by "recently updated" since available proxy pool will be constantly updated.

or you could use lantern.
