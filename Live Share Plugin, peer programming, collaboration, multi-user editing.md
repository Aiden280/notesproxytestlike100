# Live Share Plugin, peer programming, collaboration, multi-user editing

live share will always create a invitation link upon starting, so you can use clipboard listener based on event listeners or [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) (repeatedly checking content in clipboard, see if there's any change), save the link to server or send via email.

clipboard listeners:

[clipnotify](https://github.com/cdown/clipnotify) for xorg (linux)
