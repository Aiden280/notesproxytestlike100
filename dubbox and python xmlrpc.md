# dubbox and python xmlrpc

they are both remote procedure calls.

you can ship things across internet, but remember it can't be some "native" structure like numpy array.

python [xmlrpc](https://wiki.python.org/moin/XmlRpc) tutorial and [xmlrpc.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.server.html) mentions [c2 wiki](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XmlRpc) which you have scraped before. where is it, along with all other things you have scraped? believe it is in that AGI directory since you are such an archivist at that time.
