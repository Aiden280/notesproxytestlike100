# Live coding, hacking, media

I think hacking requires certain level of live coding, like fzf, interactive jq, interactive regex and repl, or my modded hy.

Interactive searching is one such kind of live coding. It can also be manual labeling, training a model.

on the other hand, media convey the idea of live coding, mostly by showing off the benefits, but hardly getting to the point when you really need it. media is not coding (requiring coding skill), it is just somehow interactive.
