# amdgpu, rocm and pytorch

find latest build in pytorch nightly repo

use sudo before invoking amdgpu related commands, otherwise unavailable

use directml (pytorch, tensorflow) instead. need windows.

you need to set the shared graphical memory to a larger value.

does not work for integrated graphic cards, and supported amd cards are limited.
