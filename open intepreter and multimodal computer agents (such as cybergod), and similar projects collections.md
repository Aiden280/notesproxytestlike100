# prerequisites for running autogpt/open intepreter and multimodal computer agents (such as cybergod), and similar projects collections

## prerequisites

run these things under virtual machine or docker, with a fixed size mountpoint. keep all ports of your local machine isolated from the agent.

when you need it to process anything, just use the mountpoint as the only data exchange location. do not let anything executable spit out from it. do not run anything generated by it programmatically.
