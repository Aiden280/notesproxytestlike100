# hacker forums

social engineering is just a fancy name for gaining trust and do shit.

in hacking we must be multilingual, as this shit is really hard to get right.

you would read them sometime do you? you would collect info from these sites do you? you would search for things when you need it do you?

You would like forums for dark web? Forum for hacking?

你要的是社工库 提取出来的账号密码库 用来撞库？百度谷歌 QQ 百度云盘 github 磁力种子搜索

when not reached, make sure you are in the channel!

legionhiden4dqh4.onion - Let's start with HeLL Reloaded, probably the only one that isn't just awful. where Tor Carding Forum (TCF) members who weren't arrested when it was seized are now dwelling! Not operated by the same people behind the original HeLL, but after the original was seized, some of the moderators and members made this site.

exoduockgfq3ikf7.onion Ex0du$, Pretty mediocre forum, lots of shitty banking botnets being sold. Also ransomeware is the big thing recently, so of course that's being sold. The code is HILARIOUS. RansomWare coded in visual basic, Java, C# and AutoIT v3! Great.

damagelabraahzcu.onion - DamageLabs primarily russian forum, looks like there's not much interesting going on here either. They have a good collection of pirated programming books.

darkod3eeziu3w5p.onion - looks like a really dead forum.

dublik2uqiorycsj.onion - dublik russian forum

forohpysho2t5mjs.onion - another random forum
