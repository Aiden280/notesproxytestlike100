# trajectory prediction, model predictive control

this reminds me of `ddpg-usv-asmc` and [Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-with-PyTorch](https://github.com/p-christ/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithms-with-PyTorch) (is it?) or [Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch](https://github.com/sweetice/Deep-reinforcement-learning-with-pytorch)
