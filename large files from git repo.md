# Remove bad/large files from git repo

Use [bfg repo cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/), avaliable in `brew`, downloadable [as a jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar).

Other tools I used either perform poorly or have complex syntax. May not work as expected!
