## DIY

if you want to do it on your own, you have to know how to send notifications on different operating systems.

```bash
osascript -e 'display notification "This message should be showing on the notification" with title "Coding Tips"'
```

on linux:

```bash
notify-send "Dinner ready!"
```

using `remind`:

remind "I'm still here" now
remind "Time to wake up!" in 5 minutes
remind "Dinner" in 1 hour
remind "Take a break" at noon
remind "It's Friday pints time!" at 17:00
```

msg /SERVER:DestinationPC * /TIME:60 â€œThis is the message to be sent to a PC named DestinationPC and closes in 60 seconds."
```
