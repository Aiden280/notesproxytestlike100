# RSIBreak, Break Reminder

if you want to do it on your own, you have to know how to send notifications on different operating systems.

on macOS:

```bash
osascript -e 'display notification "This message should be showing on the notification" with title "Coding Tips"'
```

on linux:

```bash
notify-send
```

on windows:

```cmd
msg /SERVER:DestinationPC * /TIME:60 â€œThis is the message to be sent to a PC named DestinationPC and closes in 60 seconds."
```
