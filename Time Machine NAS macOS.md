# Time Machine NAS macOS

when in doubt, delete files under GUI instead of terminal

check out commands for moving files into trash bin instead of direct removal on different OSes

----

my data under `~/works` is lost. fuck.

buy me some ssd 512GB at least to do time machine backup.

buy m.2 ssd to reduce the size.

use usb-c cables to prevent inconvenience.

----

the filesystem will be formatted as APFS.

need a dedicated usb storage for it.

do not know if it is incremental backup.
