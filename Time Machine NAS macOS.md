# Time Machine NAS macOS

my data under `~/works` is lost. fuck.

buy me some ssd 512GB at least to do time machine backup.

buy m.2 ssd to reduce the size.

use usb-c cables to prevent inconvenience.

the filesystem will be formatted as APFS.

need a dedicated usb storage for it.

do not know if it is incremental backup.
