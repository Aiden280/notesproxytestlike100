# Everything you need to startup your media project: viral video generator, viral video analyzer, trend analyzer, automated email account registration, download only a portion of video, peek video screenshots

## Viral videos

### Video editors

#### [Gifcurry](https://github.com/lettier/gifcurry)

Adding text to video, has typing effects, written in haskell. You can add `-m` flag to export video instead of GIF.

#### [Backgroundremover](https://github.com/nadermx/backgroundremover)

A commandline tool powered by torch, removing background from images and video

#### [Moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy) most loved commandline video editor?

There are some [cool text effects](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/examples/moving_letters.html) called "Text with moving letters" (PPT-like), and a [dancing video generator](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/examples/dancing_knights.html) based on tempo finder and video loop maker. The [Star-Wars Text Effect](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/examples/star_worms.html) reminds me of easing functions used with page scrolling.

### Data collect/analyze

#### [ViralCaster](https://github.com/jjbreen/ViralCaster)

[TitleParser.py](https://github.com/jjbreen/ViralCaster/blob/master/TitleParser.py) analyses views along with words, getting the most "popular" word or word combinations. It has demo data. It generates "max" "min" "mean" views related to single word or word combinations.

#### [Predictube](https://github.com/dubstack/Predictube)

[peak_detection.py](https://github.com/dubstack/Predictube/blob/master/predictube/analyze/peak_detection/peak_detection.py) use daily view count to categorize and identify trends. "MonoIncr" might be our desired category.
