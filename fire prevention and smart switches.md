# fire prevention and smart switches

we introduce some chain reaction like mechanism, to turn off corresponding wifi-connected switches when specific signal is received.

put temperature & smoke detectors and fireballs around many places, especially for those long-running machines. once fire detected, send alarm notification and switch off the main power controller.

fire countermeasure shall be linked to smart power switches (once triggered, cut off the power), and placed evenly to potential area

although it might be less likely to have devastating fire catastropies inside if procedure mentioned above is done correctly, fire outside the domesticated area is also concerned.

we shall first make sure living objects can escape in time. once fire outside the room is detected, all important files shall be uploaded to the cloud. if fire is inside, cut off the power and use UPS to continue execution. make sure important data and devices can be carried around, and countermeasures will stop the propagation of fire (to isolate air from fire, even if fire is inside)
