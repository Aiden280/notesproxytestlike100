# AGI that controls computer

## encoding

use hfft to transform multipart inputs (special bits, different part of mouse coords (x, y, dx, dy))

if you want to use complex number as input, you may need to swap ViT for ComplexConv2D

----

libraries that handle complex neural networks:

[complexPyTorch](https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/complexPyTorch)

## multimodal

do our model have to output multimodal data?
