# recycle bin, trash can cli alternative

[trash-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli) may work cross-platform, but manage its own recycle bin instead of the system if using windows or macos

## windows

[cmdutils](http://www.maddogsw.com/cmdutils/) which has `recycle` and `bin` commands

[cmd-recycle](https://github.com/kizzx2/cmd-recycle/)

[nircmd](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)

```cmd
nircmd moverecyclebin *.tmp
```

## macos

[trash](https://hasseg.org/trash/)

## linux
