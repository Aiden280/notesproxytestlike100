# recycle bin, trash can cli alternative

[trash-cli]() may work cross-platform, but manage its own recycle bin instead of the system if using windows or macos

## windows

[cmdutils](http://www.maddogsw.com/cmdutils/) which has `recycle` and `bin` commands

[cmd-recycle](https://github.com/kizzx2/cmd-recycle/)

[nircmd]()

```cmd
nircmd moverecyclebin *.tmp
```

## macos

## linux
