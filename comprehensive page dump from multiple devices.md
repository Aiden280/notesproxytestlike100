# comprehensive page dump from multiple devices

i said taking notes manually is always a bad idea if you can just do it with LLM.

to get latest [news](), [trends]() from github, use some rss feeds.

to monitor discord channels, monitor QQ chats, wechat messages and filter links out of it.

to dump pages and clipboards from devices, which is what we are trying to do.

better keep it tight. when doing so, you want to make it is absolutely private. nothing is public.

you can use a filter or something. you can also just keep it discrete.
