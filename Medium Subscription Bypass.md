# Medium Subscription Bypass

map `*.medium.com/[URL]` to `scribe.rip/[URL]`

or try to host `scribe.rip` yourself.

[source code](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe) hosted on [sourcehunt](https://sr.ht).

[alternative scribe instances](https://git.sr.ht/~edwardloveall/scribe/tree/main/item/docs/instances.md) seems all blocked (in mainland)
