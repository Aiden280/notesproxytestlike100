# ask chatgpt how to create an ai model for controlling computer under human instruction

## question

how do i design an ai model using gpt, rnn, lstm, vit to accept computer display screenshots and human instructions as input, keyboard and mouse events as output, trained on random keystrokes and mouse events, also human instructions paired with human demonstrations? show me python code

## answers

### GPT4

Designing an AI model that combines GPT, RNN, LSTM, and ViT for the task you described is complex and requires deep understanding of these architectures. However, I'll provide you with a high-level overview and a basic structure of the code to help you get started.

1. First, process the input data:
   - For computer display screenshots, use a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to extract features.
   - For human instructions, use a GPT model to encode the natural language instructions.
2. Combine the features from both the ViT and GPT models.
3. Use an LSTM or RNN to process the combined features and maintain the temporal context.
4. Finally, decode the output of the LSTM/RNN into keyboard and mouse events.

Here's a basic structure of the code:

```python
import torch
import torchvision
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Model

# Load pretrained models
gpt_model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')
vit_model = torchvision.models.vit_b_16(pretrained=True)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

class CustomModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, gpt_model, vit_model, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(CustomModel, self).__init__()

        self.gpt_model = gpt_model
        self.vit_model = vit_model
        self.rnn = torch.nn.LSTM(input_size=hidden_size, hidden_size=hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = torch.nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, instructions, screenshots):
        # Encode instructions using GPT2
        inputs = tokenizer(instructions, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
        gpt_output = self.gpt_model(**inputs)
        gpt_features = gpt_output.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]

        # Encode screenshots using ViT
        vit_output = self.vit_model(screenshots)
        vit_features = vit_output["last_hidden_state"][:, 0, :]

        # Combine features
        combined_features = torch.cat((gpt_features, vit_features), dim=1)

        # Process combined features through an RNN
        rnn_output, _ = self.rnn(combined_features.unsqueeze(1))

        # Decode the output into keyboard and mouse events
        output = self.fc(rnn_output.squeeze(1))

        return output

# Instantiate the custom model
model = CustomModel(gpt_model, vit_model, hidden_size=1024, output_size=256)

# Train and evaluate the model using your dataset
```

You'll need to collect a dataset with computer display screenshots, human instructions, and paired keyboard and mouse events. Then, preprocess the data, split it into training and validation sets, and train the model using an appropriate loss function and optimizer.

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point, and you may need to experiment with different architectures, loss functions, and hyperparameters to achieve the desired performance.
